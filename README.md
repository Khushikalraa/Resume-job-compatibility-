Resume and Job Listing Matching System
Project Overview
This project is a Python-based system designed to match a candidate's resume data with a job listing to evaluate compatibility. The goal is to identify overlapping skills, experience, and education between the resume and job requirements, providing an insightful match evaluation.


Features

Data Extraction: The project uses resume_data and job_listing_data modules to extract structured information such as skills, experience, and education from a resume and a job listing.

Matching Algorithm: Implements functions to compare:

Skills: Finds common skills between the candidate and the job requirements.

Experience: Matches job titles or relevant experience.

Education: Matches educational qualifications.

Comprehensive Match Analysis:

Matches across all three categories (skills, experience, education).

Provides detailed insights into overlapping qualifications.


Evaluation Metrics

To assess the quality of the matching system, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are computed:

Precision: Measures the accuracy of matched data relative to the total identified matches.

Recall: Assesses how much relevant data was successfully matched.

F1-Score: A balanced metric considering both precision and recall.


Example Outputs

Extracted and matched data is displayed, showing overlaps in skills, experience, and education.
Metrics provide an understanding of how well the resume aligns with the job listing.
Potential Use Cases

Recruitment Tools: Automate the screening process by evaluating candidate-job compatibility.

Job Portals: Enhance candidate recommendations for job listings.

Career Guidance: Help candidates identify gaps in skills or experience for specific roles.
